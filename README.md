We celebrate Nov 5 as a culture like we celebrate Dashain for family and  relatives gathering to share joys and sorrow. Its just like that.

- **Indian Hackers are constantly hacking our sites. Can't you hack them back?**<br>

2) Security status herne ho vane nepali sites are much more weaker than Indian sites.  If Indian leets really start, then Nepal's digital assets would be totally down or destroyed, and if all Nepali pentesters do too, not more than 10% of Indian government sites would be affected.
